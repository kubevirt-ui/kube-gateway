![alt gopher network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaacov/kube-gateway/main/docs/network-side.png)

Use k8s API for your web application. kube-gateway allow web application to connect to k8s API using signed tokens, without giving 
the web application users k8s accounts in the cluster, the signed tokens are specific to a k8s resource or resources and limited by time. 

## What can I do with it ?

- Create web applications that use k8s API, without giving users a user account in the cluster.
  (e.g. create a web application that allow authenticated users to access some k8s resource, without requiring users to also have k8s accounts)
- Allow external web application to create signed links that include a time limited token to access k8s resources.
  (e.g. send emails with a link that is valid for the next 3 hours and allow access to specific k8s resource)

## Build

Using go install:


``` bash
```
